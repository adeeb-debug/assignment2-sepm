"# assignment2-sepm" 
				Humanoid Project		

First we need to clone the repository from the github then we need to install xammp in the local machine. we also need to use the same password as in app.php in repository.
once we logged in the xammp and then access the mysql then copy the content of the mysql query and then paste it there where you are logged in. it will create three dummy users: Admin, Assistant and root with their password and then run these softwares (Apache and sql).
the cloned repository has to be in either C,xammp or HD docx. then run it in  your local machine using host/humanoid this command.
Now, it will be the website running and now you can use those dummy users to login and visit pages.
